## LiDAR Point Cloud Vectorization

This project aims to perform LiDAR vectorization using the Vancouver dataset. The goal is to classify and vectorize different elements within the LiDAR point cloud data.

### Classes

The classes from 0 are as follows:
- Bare-earth and low grass
- Low vegetation (height <2m)
- High vegetation (height >2m)
- Water
- Buildings
- Other
- Noise (noise points, blunders, outliers, etc.)

### Project Overview

The project involves processing LiDAR data to accurately identify and vectorize various elements in the dataset. This includes distinguishing between different types of vegetation, buildings, water bodies, and other features, while also filtering out noise and errors.

### Dataset

The Vancouver dataset is used for this project, providing a comprehensive set of LiDAR data points for analysis and vectorization.

### Goals

- Accurate classification of LiDAR data points into predefined classes.
- Vectorization of classified data for further analysis and application.
- Noise reduction and error handling to improve data quality.

### Usage

Instructions on how to use the project will be provided in subsequent sections.
